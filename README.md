General Data Transformations server

x4 will do the following. Note the "future tense", however.

- work on RESTful platform
- have a function "list". For example, http://www.x4.com/list will return a JSON such as:
-- {"reverse" : "Reverse your input string", "xml2Json" : "Convert XML to JSon equivalent" }
Note: www.x4.com is used merely as a placeholder. I am not too optimistic the domain is available

Contributions will be invited for implementing more functions. x4 will try to evolve a framework to manage all kinds of functions.
